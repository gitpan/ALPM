	* lib/ALPM.pm (transaction): Removed type parameter from
	transaction method.

	* ALPM.xs: Renamed ALPM::DB method set_server to add_url.

2010-05-29  Justin Davis  <juster@cpan.org>

	* RELEASE (0.08): Uploaded to CPAN.

	* typemap (find_group): Fix a bug with group type conversion.
	This caused ALPM::DB::find_group() to croak instead of (properly)
	returning undef when given a group name that didn't exist.
	Reported by Andre Schmidt. Thanks!

2010-05-24  Justin Davis  <juster@cpan.org>

	* ALPM.xs (ALPM::Package): Renamed compute_requiredby method to
	requiredby.

2010-05-02  Justin Davis  <juster@cpan.org>

	* t/04-FakeRepos.t: Add support for .pkg.tar.xz package files.

	* lib/ALPM/LoadConfig.pm: Add support for UseDelta setting in
	pacman.conf.

2010-01-25  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>

	* t/04-FakeRepos.t (create_repos): Fixed problems with test
	04-FakeRepos where packages would fail to build.  Changed
	generated test packages to arch "any" so we don't have to check
	our arch.

	* Makefile.PL: "make clean" will now delete the test repository
	share directories (t/repos/share) and the test root
	directory (t/root) automatically.


2010-01-04  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>

	* 0.5 (RELEASE)

	* lib/ALPM/LoadConfig.pm (_make_parser): Tweaked regex to accept empty values.
	Removed error when an unknown field name is given.

	* lib/ALPM.pm: Added ability to set usedelta option, which was missing.

	* Makefile.PL: Added repository URL to the META.yml.

	* t/07-TiedOptions.t: Hides the warning for the last test using $SIG{__WARN__}.

	* t/04-FakeRepos.t (create_repos): Fixed a bug where I must use
	the --asroot option when running makepkg inside makepkg, because
	of fakeroot.

2009-10-29  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>

	* 0.4: Released version 0.4

2009-10-08  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>

	* lib/ALPM.pm (transaction): 'flags' are now passed as a string
	of flag names separated by spaces.  Added the sysupgrade
	transaction 'type'.

	* ALPM.xs: Added conv and progress callbacks for transactions.

2009-09-03  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>

	* ALPM.xs: s/alpm_pkg_get_/alpm_pkg_/;

	* lib/ALPM/DB.pm: Renamed get_pkg_cache() to packages().

	* lib/ALPM.pm: Changed methods local_db to localdb, get_sync_dbs
	to syncdbs, get_repo_db to repodb, and added search.

	- Updated to version 3.30 of pacman.  The upgrade changes
	many constants and functions.
	- I have declared war on the get_ named methods.  It seems silly
	to have all these get_ methods when there is no set_ method for
	anything except ALPM options (whose prefix I will keep).

2005-08-05  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>
