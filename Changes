* Release 2.00

** Upgrade for Pacman 3.5
   Converted to the new libalpm that is distributed with pacman 3.5.

*** alpm_db_register_local removed
    You don't have to call ALPM->register() to register the local DB.
    The local DB is registered automatically when you call
    ALPM->localdb aka ALPM->get_opt( 'localdb' ).  ALPM::ParseConfig
    no longer takes the 'autoregister' parameter.

*** Transaction functions absorbed into install() and uninstall()
    The two new ALPM::Transaction methods, install and uninstall,
    replace the old sync, pkgfile, remove, and sync_from_db
    methods.

    The new methods take package objects as arguments. The old
    methods took package names as arguments. This reflects the same
    libalpm changes.

** ALPM method aliases removed
   For some reason I made aliases everytime I changed a function name.
   I don't think anyone uses this module anyways so I just yanked out
   a bunch of old method aliases I had setup. The following are
   removed from the ALPM class, just use their alternate names.

   |----------------+--------------|
   | Removed Method | "New" Method |
   |----------------+--------------|
   | register_db    | register     |
   | transaction    | trans        |
   | action         | trans        |
   | databases      | dbs          |
   | repodb         | db           |
   |----------------+--------------|

** New Changelog Format
   Ditched the old GNU-style ChangeLog format for an org-mode file. Old
   ChangeLog entries are at the end of the file...

	share directories (t/repos/share) and the test root
	directory (t/root) automatically.


2010-01-04  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>

	of fakeroot.

2009-10-29  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>

	* 0.4: Released version 0.4

2009-10-08  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>

2009-09-03  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>

	* ALPM.xs: s/alpm_pkg_get_/alpm_pkg_/;

	* lib/ALPM.pm: Changed methods local_db to localdb, get_sync_dbs
	to syncdbs, get_repo_db to repodb, and added search.

	- Updated to version 3.30 of pacman.  The upgrade changes
	many constants and functions.
	- I have declared war on the get_ named methods.  It seems silly
	to have all these get_ methods when there is no set_ method for
	anything except ALPM options (whose prefix I will keep).

2005-08-05  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>
	0.03
        - Added transaction support with ALPM::Transaction.
	- Implemented callback options to ALPM and also transaction
        callbacks using the transaction() method.
        - Created tied hash interface to ALPM options just for fun.

2009-07-15  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>
	0.02
	- Added ALPM::LoadConfig which is used to load pacman.conf
        config files

2009-05-03  Justin Davis  <jrcd83@gmail.com>
	0.01
	- First public release, uploading to CPAN
	- Has just about everything working except syncing/transactions
