ALPM version 3.00
=================

This is a perl XS module which provides an interface to the libalpm C library.
libalpm is used by Archlinux (and other distributions) who use pacman as the
package managing program.

In this way, ALPM is a low-level interface to packages and the package
managing database system.  You can do things like search, upgrade, and
install packages using the library.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the alpm C library that is included with
ArchLinux's pacman. While developing I have used, among other
versions, libalpm 7.0.2 included with pacman version 4.0.2.
