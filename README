ALPM version 3.02
=================

This is a perl XS module which provides an interface to the libalpm C library.
libalpm is used by Archlinux (and other distributions) who use pacman as the
package managing program. In this way, ALPM is a low-level interface to
packages and the package managing database system.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the alpm C library that is included with
ArchLinux's pacman. While developing I have used libalpm 8.0.0
included with pacman version 4.1.0.
