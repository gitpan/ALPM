=head1 NAME

ALPM::Package - libalpm packages of files, with dependencies, etc.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ALPM::Conf qw(/etc/pacman.conf);
  my $perlpkg = $alpm->localdb->find('perl');

  ## All package methods are accessors.

  my $name = $perlpkg->name();
  print "$name rocks!\n";

  ## Here is an ugly trick. Please forgive me.
  print "@{[$perlpkg->name]} rocks!\n";

  ## Dependencies are arrayrefs of hashrefs (AoH):
  print "$name depends on:\n";
  for my $deps (@{$perlpkg->depends}){
      print "  @{$dep}{'name', 'mod', 'version'}\n";
  }

  ## File lists are also arrayrefs of hashrefs (AoH):
  print "$name owns files:\n";
  for my $f (@{$perlpkg->files}){
      print "\t%s %o %d", $f->{'name'}, $f->{'mode'}, $f->{'size'};
  }
  
  ## Others lists are arrayrefs of scalars:
  print "$name owns files:\n";
  print "  $_\n" foreach (@{$perlpkg->licenses});

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is a wrapper for all of the C<alpm_pkg_...> C library functions
of libalpm.  You retrieve the package from the database and you can then
access its information.

=head1 ACCESSORS

The accessors are named I<(almost)> exactly the same as the
C<alpm_pkg_get...> functions.  They are easy to use if you only want a
few attributes.

I have removed the get_ prefix on the accessors.  This is because you
can't really I<set> anything so you should know it's a get anyways.

Attributes with plural names return an arrayref of strings. I<depends> and I<files> return
an arrayref of hashrefs. I<db> returns an L<ALPM::DB> object.
